Library using the LDG system and the dosfs functions, only for floppy disks images (hard disk support is removed), taken from ggnkuaâ€™s Jacknife Total Commander plugin, and modified a little to rename files/folders (and volume name if present in the FAT).

Used by: KK Commander to handle ST and MSA floppy disks images.
Other programs can use it, please read KKcmd GFA sources (dfs_* functions) as exemple.
